# PizzaSales-PowerBI
Dashboard created with the PowerBi Desktop tool. This one was based on a dataset of sales data from a fictitious Pizzeria. <br/>
The dataset can be found here: https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground. I thank the creator. <br/>
I tried testing with different things on the dashboard, like DAX and KPI. I used this video to help me with the KPI part: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTs9Z0ogUrk. I thank the creator. <br/>
I also used a pizza image as the background. This image can be found on this image sharing site: https://pixabay.com/pt/photos/pizza-comida-it%c3%a1lia-3000274/. I thank the creator. <br/>
Finally, i exported the dashboard to a PDF to see the final result.
